/**
1) as root, compile race.c (use the makefile), make race
    cd /questions/race
    make 

2) Verify that hacker can not view or edit /etc/passwd2


3) Explain what the setuid bit being set means for race, when run by hacker.

4) As hacker, run /questions/race/race to understand how it works and what it does

5) As hacker, explain how hacker exploits /questions/race/race
   so that they modify the root only readable and writable file /etc/passwd2

6) As hacker, explain how hacker exploits /questions/race/race
   so that they end up with a root shell

   Be careful when doing this you may lock yourself out of the system!!
   I have made a backup of /etc/passwd in /etc/passwd.bak
   make sure you have a root shell when playing with the passwd
   file.

7) Fix the code below so that it eliminates the race condition and 
   allows race to safely write to /tmp/permitted, no matter which user
   owns the file.
