a) The rule for growing the number of DictEntries is: 
   You can modify this if you change the rule.

   When to grow: What is the condition that triggers a grow?

	Adding a new (key,value) pair to a full row (capacity==numEntries)

   How to grow: Do you double the number of entries, add 10 more entries?

	capacity = 2*capacity

   Justification for above: Argue why this is the right thing to do.

	Expanding in this way leads to amortized constant cost/entry
	when we are expanding only.

b) The rule for shrinking the number of DictEntries is:

   When to shrink: What is the condition that triggers a shrink?

   	The condition for triggering a shrink is when maximum of all number of entries are less than half of its capacity. The capactiy of all entries are the same, so
      first row might have 2 entries and 16 as capacity while second row might have 15 entries with 16 as capacity.

   How to shrink: Do you cut the number of entries in half, subtract 10?

   	Cut the number of entries in half.

   Justification for above: Argue why this is the right thing to do.

   	Shrink operation will only takes log n with base 2 to completely remove a row with entries capacity n. It reduces time complexity comparing to reducing number 
      of entries by 10.

a) The rule for growing the number of DictRows is:

   When to grow: What is the condition that triggers a grow?

   	Number of dict rows grow when minimum of all number of entries is larger than half of current capacity. Each newly added row get same capacity.

   How to grow: Do you double the number of rows, add 10 more rows?

   	Double the number of rows.

   Justification for above: Argue why this is the right thing to do.

   	If we don't expand number of rows in above situation where minimum of all possible number of entries is at least half of current capacity, it would
      take too much time for dictget and dictdel because they need to traverse each has to traverse at least n/2 in worst case. n is capacity. By adding new row, 
      we can significantly reduce searching time for above two sequences. 

b) The rule for shrinking the number of DictRows is:

   When to shrink: What is the condition that triggers a shrink?

      Number of dictRows shrinks by half when all entries in last n/2 row to n row are all empty. n is total number of rows.

   How to shrink: Do you cut the number of rows in half, subtract 10?

   	Cut the number of rows in half. 

   Justification for above: Argue why this is the right thing to do.

   	It is only possible to shrink rows when rows are empty, otherwise it would cause a memory leak or loss of data.
