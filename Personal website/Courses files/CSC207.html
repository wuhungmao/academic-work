        <p>
            This course mainly focuses on java concept and design patterns. 
            Since I had no experience with java and ChatGPT wasn't a thing yet 
            and professor decided to give a fast paced teaching and I took 5 courses
            that semester, I did terribly in this course. It was a valuable lesson though, 
            not to take too many courses in one semester and pick a good professor.
