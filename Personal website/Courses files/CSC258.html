        <h2>Reflection: </h2>
        <p>I took this course with professor Andrew Petersen. He is a smart guy and expects
            students to quickly understand course material. With that being said, he give fast 
            paced lecture and if I got distracted from his lecture for like 10 minutes, I would feel 
            I miss something important. Overall, the course was pretty fun learning how program got 
            converted to assembly code and execute one by one on computer hardware.
