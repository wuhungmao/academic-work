        <h2>Reflection: </h2>
        <p>I took this course with Andreas Bergen. Her way of teaching is different 
            from other professor in that she focus on problem solving in her lecture. 
            Instead of explaining abstract concept and leave practice question for students,
            she shows us how to solve a problem with a new concept at the same time explaining it. 
            This way of learning is more effective than just passively listen in lecture.
