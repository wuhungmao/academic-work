        <p>
            I did terribly at this course. I remember I got 40+ for my first assignment, 
            I had no foundation and no experience with script writing and debugging was
            extremely difficult to me. The syntax was not very inituitive and professor
            arnold wanted us to look up a specific thing on internet to be able to do 
            the assignment. It is not a good experience overall, and assignment 2 was one 
            of the most tedious assignments I have seen in a cs courses. We had to read 
            valgrind report and read documentation on the internet. It is so time consuming 
            and stress me out knowing I have other assignments to work on. I guess reading
            documentation is necessary and basic skill for a computer science student.
