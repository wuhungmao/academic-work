        <h2>Reflection: </h2>
        <p>I heard that the statistic department in UTM is worst of all departments. Honestly, 
            that's absolutely 100% true. I first went to professor xu's lecture, but he has such strong 
            chinese accent that I would rather listen to him explaining statistic concept in
            chinese. I had to go to another professor's lecture, but the other professor did 
            not teach well either. He went through slides slide by slide and solve some problem
            in between. The problem is, he was terrible at organizing his writing. He could write 
            the solution across the whole board and make it hard to track. However, the course 
            content only cover foundamental statistic concept, so I guess students can find 
            other ways to study for midterm and final exam instead.
