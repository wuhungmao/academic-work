        <h2>Reflection: </h2>
        <p>I took this course with professor Ivan Khatchatourian, he is one of the best professor in UTM. 
            He gives detailed explanation and stop to answer questions during the course. Nonetheless, I 
            still find this course really difficult, to be more precise, a fucking pain in the ass. 
            The problem is the assignments. The assignments usually have around 8 questions, 
            a little bit of them is calculation, while the other are proof. Out of these 
            questions only 5 are marked. As a student who never expose under mathematical proof in a systematic 
            manner, most of the time I just stare at the questions and not sure how to proceed. I never found
            math to be this difficult before taking this course. There was no answer provided to practice questions
            or other practice. The only way to know is to ask on piazza, which is super ineffcient. Like who the 
            hell is going to make over 50 posts a week for practice questions he has done during that week. If there 
            isn't a good way to know if my solution to simple practice question is correct or not,
            how am I gonna do those much more advanced assignment questions. Each question is worth 20 percent in 
            the assignment and it is possible to spend hours on a question that the first step I took was wrong already. 
            Even having read the solution to those assignment questions would not help in any way for the next assignment.
