        <h2>Grade: 85/100 </h2>
        <h2>Reflection: </h2>
        <p>This course is cruel to many first year students.
            Thanks to the mental and physical suffers of MAT137, I find this course 
            easy. I remember a typical quiz has 2 questions, both are proof question.
            So a student either get 0, 50 or 100 depends on whether they can do the proofs. 
            However, I would say this course is easier to learn, by which I mean a student 
            can effectively boost his mark if he is willing to put effort into studying. There
            is plenty of practice questions with answer and professor put effort to teach, not
            to mention the textbook isn't too long and idea is explained concisely.
            There are some courses in utm that are way worse than this one, like MAT157.
