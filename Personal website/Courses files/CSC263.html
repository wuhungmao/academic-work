        <p>This course is pretty simple. We learnt about data structures, 
            amortized analysis and algorithms. I took this course with professor 
            bahar. Though she only goes through ppt, she explains things step by 
            step and in a slowed pace. She even give student chocolate at the end of 
            this course. Taking this course is relatively less stressful, but doing 
            midterm and final exam of this type of course feel like doing a IQ test. 
            Overall, this course is pretty fun, highly recommended.
