        <h2>Grade: 77/100 </h2>
        <h2>Reflection: </h2>
        <p>This course cover many important theoretical concept such as master's theorem, 
           time complexity, regular expression for future cs courses. Professor ashraf can 
           create a serious atomsphere and he provided detailed explanation to questions covered
           in classes. This course is heavy in terms of workload. Every assignment requires 
           to write proof on latex and we are expected to write like professional. Part of the reason
           I am not getting 80s in this course is because I cannot write my proof like professionals. 
           Just to show you how painful it is, I have attached two pictures below, first picture 
           is the things you type on latex, second picture is what you get. 
        </p>
