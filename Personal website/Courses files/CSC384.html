        <h2>Reflection: </h2>
        <p>I took this course with professor sonya and bahar. Whenever I see these 
            two professors, I knew this quality of course was guaranteed to be great.
            Both are amazing professors and they do their best to assist students. 
            In specific, they record lecture even during a non-covid time. They provided
            practice problem and sample exam questions for student to study. I would like 
            to give them a round of applause and thanks for their efforts. The course 
            content itself is pretty simple except last two weeks which we talked about 
            knowledge based representation.
