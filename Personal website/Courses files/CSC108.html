        <h2>Reflection: </h2>
        <p>I had done programming before taking this course, so I find this course pretty simple.
            Course content covers simple programming knowledge such as variable, list.... Python itself is 
            pretty straightforward so I guess most people do well as I do. The only problem is that some people who haven't touched
            programming before might not be able to adapt to university pace. It can be challenging to beginner as there are a lot of
            stuff to learn and have to build a programming mindset that will only be developed by practicing. However, as 
            first year cs course that accommodate large group of student, this course is properly coordinated and organized.
