        <h2>Reflection: </h2>
        <p>I took this course with professor Jessica Burgner. This course is more math heavy 
            compare to other cs courses, though there are some programming to do. Each assignment
            must be completed in a group of two, so finding a good teammate is a great start. My
            teammate was absolutely amazing. He can make every assignment submitted
            look perfect and present the work in a highly organized and professional way. I am
            truly impressed by the amount of effort he put in the assignment. Other than that, I
            would recommend this course to people who loves linear algebra and programming. I 
            have decided not to enter robot industry as I am not a big fan of math, but the 
            franka robot was really cool though.
