        <p>
            I took this course with professor Andrew petersen. Similar to CSC258, he gives
            fast paced lecture. I would recommended to read textbook and study course material
            prior to going to his lecture becuase he explains a lot of stuff in 2 hours every week.
            Any lack of relevant knowledge might result in confusion during his lecture. The course
            content takes some time to grasp and debugging multiple threads is not only a pain in the
            ass but also very time consuming. Each assignment requires a ideally 5+ pages analysis report
            and heavy c++/c coding. There is a lot of problems to solve along the way, like memory issues,
            synchronization issues, writing script to draw graph for analysis, etc. None of this is extremely
            difficult to solve with the help of ChatGPT, but they are kind of annoying when they show up 
            over and over again.
