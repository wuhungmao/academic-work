        <p>
            I took this course with professor Ivan Khatchatourian. This course is pretty
            simple. Every week we have some reading as well as some practice problem to do. 
            The practice problem was very interesting in that it provided step by step explanation
            to foundamental idea in linear algebra. This course is honestly one of the best
            course I have taken in UTM. It is not as proof intensive as MAT137 but there were 
            some simple proof to do. Overall, this course was fun.
