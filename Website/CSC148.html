        <p>
            This course cover more advanced stuff like linked list and expose student with the idea
            of memory address. This memory address idea is quite important and will constantly show up
            in higher cs courses. I took this course with professor sonya. She explains stuff pretty clearly
            , but I didn't pay much attention in class. I remember I got 65 in my first assignment because I 
            was too cocky and didn't put too much effort into debugging. I only realised there is a 
            file for debugging until the last few hours.

            To get into cs POSt I must get 80 in this course, and getting 65 in my first assignment would mean
            extra effort, or more than 80 in the rest of the course. So I had to work extra.

            This is a very important course that test a student got admitted as "computer science student"
            whether they are eligible and should be doing a computer science degree. This course exists to 
            filter out those unqualified students. I met some people who wanted to study computer science 
            had to switch to other programs such as economics or go to another university if they ever want to 
            graduate. This POSt system really screw up some people as far as I know.
